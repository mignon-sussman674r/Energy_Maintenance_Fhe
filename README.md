# Energy Maintenance FHE: A Confidential Computing Platform for Predictive Maintenance in the Energy Sector

Energy Maintenance FHE is a cutting-edge platform designed specifically for the energy sector, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. Our solution allows energy companies, such as wind farms, to securely upload FHE-encrypted operating data from their devices. An AI model then performs homomorphic fault predictions without exposing sensitive operational details, ensuring both privacy and security.

## The Challenge in Energy Management

The energy sector is home to various operational challenges, particularly in predictive maintenance. Traditional methods often rely on unencrypted data, leading to vulnerabilities where sensitive business information may be exposed. Companies need a solution that protects proprietary data while still enabling effective analysis and prediction of equipment failures. The lack of privacy in data processing can directly lead to increased operational costs and risks, thus jeopardizing both efficiency and security.

## How FHE Reshapes the Landscape

Fully Homomorphic Encryption provides a robust solution to these challenges. By employing FHE technology from **Zamaâ€™s open-source libraries** like **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, our platform allows the execution of computations directly on encrypted data. This means companies can analyze sensitive information without ever decrypting it. As a result, energy firms can perform predictive maintenance with confidence, ensuring that their operational secrets remain secure while enhancing system reliability.

## Core Functionalities

### ðŸš€ Key Features:
- **FHE-Encrypted Device Operation Data**: The platform allows for seamless encryption of operating data from DePIN sensors, safeguarding sensitive information.
- **AI Fault Prediction Model**: Utilizes advanced AI algorithms to perform fault predictions in a homomorphic manner, ensuring operational insights without revealing underlying data.
- **Enhanced Security and Efficiency**: Improve the safety and efficiency of energy facilities without compromising on business confidentiality.
- **Industrial IoT Integration**: Tailored insights and analytics for smart energy systems.
- **Monitoring Dashboard & Predictive Reports**: An intuitive dashboard displays real-time monitoring metrics and predictive maintenance reports.

## Technology Stack

The Energy Maintenance FHE platform is built using:
- **Zama SDKs**: Concrete, TFHE-rs, or the zama-fhe SDK for confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for compiling and testing smart contracts.
- **Express**: Web framework for backend services and RESTful APIs.

## Getting Started

To set up the Energy Maintenance FHE project, make sure you have Node.js and Hardhat installed on your machine.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Download the project files** (ensure you do not use `git clone`).
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to download necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. This will fetch the required Zama FHE libraries along with other dependencies.

## Compiling and Running the Project

Once your environment is set up, you can compile and test the project with the following commands:

### Compile the Smart Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Running Tests
To ensure everything is correctly set up, run:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Running the Application
To start the application, execute:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a snippet that demonstrates how to encrypt and perform a prediction using our AI model:

```javascript
const { encryptData } = require('./utils/encryption');
const { predictFault } = require('./models/AI_Model');

const operatingData = {
    pressure: 20,
    temperature: 75,
    vibration: 0.02
};

async function runPrediction() {
    const encryptedData = await encryptData(operatingData);
    const prediction = predictFault(encryptedData);
    console.log("Predicted Fault Status:", prediction);
}

runPrediction();
```
